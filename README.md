# Managing Platforms With Configu

![Configu](src/configu-icon-white.svg)

This is the repository to accompany the [Configu](https://configu.io) practical tutorials section. It is a
(mostly) default "Hello, World" style React JS application that depends on a very simple configuration 
schema. It's designed for you to fork and experiment with while you work through the Configu tutorials, and
as a sandbox to experiment with handling different kinds of configuration formats. 

The standard scripts and configuration files have been ejected into `scripts` and `scripts/config` respectively,
we encourage you to envision the contents there as they relate to things we'd normally see serviced by some kind
of ad-hoc configuration pipeline, and how easy it could be to think in terms of schema objects instead.

See the shipped `.env` file for the simple configuration variable.

## Configu's Client Libraries Are Open Source As Well

While you work through tutorials like this, you might say to yourself "_Hey, self: If this command worked a little 
differently, it would be perfect for our setup_" - well, we've got great news! Configu's client libraries as well
as the CLI the implements them are open source, so you can experiment with changing them to meet your needs exactly.

We feel that this kind of experimenting is critical to building products that really solve the pain that developers
and devops engineers feel around configuration deployments - so we encourage all of our users to share them with each
other as well as with us, so we can drive Configu's features based on the work you're doing every day.

We can't promise that we'll include every idea, but we learn something from each one. Even if it seems trivial or
way too specific to your environment, anything you share with us or back to the community is appreciated, and will
be received as such.

## Want To Help Spread The Word?

The best way to help us help you is to write a short blog post about how you're using Configu to make some part of
your job easier! Whether it's technical things like finally manging all of the secret managers, or not needing to 
trigger builds to deploy new configs, or whatever Configu does that makes you bite your lip a little less - write 
it up and send us the link. 

If you need help editing or need a native English speaker to help get the story out, reach out to us and we'll be
glad to help! You'll have our sincere thanks and appreciation that our new, modern way of configuration management
will ease the pain for others, too.
